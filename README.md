# a-star-react
A* Search algorithm implemented in Javascript with a React.js user interface. Uses a priority queue ordered by the sum of the path cost and a heuristic (Manhattan distance to goal) to prioritise which square to explore next. As a tie-breaker, it uses the square of the Euclidean distance to the goal.
